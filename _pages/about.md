I am a Principal AI Scientist at [Vanguard](https://corporate.vanguard.com/), specializing in artificial intelligence research with a focus on computational models of natural language processing. My work includes AI-powered natural language generation, machine learning applications for detecting cognitive impairment and mental health issues, and advancing human-robot interaction through AI systems.

With a PhD in Computer Science from the [University of Bath, UK](https://www.bath.ac.uk/), I bring over a decade of experience in artificial intelligence research across industry, academia, and non-profit organizations. My machine learning solutions have created practical impact, from developing healthcare tools for clinical trials and senior care applications to programming a humanoid robot that engages customers in shopping environments using advanced natural language processing techniques.

As an advocate for open-source artificial intelligence, I have contributed to major AI projects including [BLOOM LLM](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloom) and [BIG-Bench](https://github.com/google/BIG-bench), working toward more reliable and accessible AI technologies. My work in machine learning research focuses on ensuring ethical AI development and has established me as a respected voice in the field.

My research has been recognised by the artificial intelligence and natural language processing community, with awards including being named among the [Top 50 Most Extraordinary Women Advancing AI](https://globalbizoutlook.com/the-50-top-most-extraordinary-women-advancing-ai-in-2024/) in 2024, the [Top 25 Women in AI in Canada](https://blog.re-work.co/top-25-women-in-ai-canada/) in 2022, and receiving the ["Industry Icon Award" from the University of Toronto](https://youtu.be/SnbylyYayuo?si=NIK6pHGmIo8UNOQA&t=173) in 2021.

I was fortunate to work with brilliant researchers in the field. I have worked, among many others, with [Joana Bryson](https://www.joannajbryson.org/) (now at Hertie School in Berlin, Germany), with [Verena Rieser](https://sites.google.com/site/verenateresarieser/) (now at Google DeepMind), with [Oliver Lemon](https://sites.google.com/site/olemon/) at the [Heriot-Watt University](https://www.hw.ac.uk/about/our-schools/mathematical-and-computer-sciences) in Edinburgh, UK, and with [Frank Rudzicz](https://web.cs.dal.ca/~rudzicz/) (now at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada).
